[[getting-started-overview]]
== Overview

Spring Roo is an easy-to-use development tool for quickly building web applications in the Java programming language, which can be used as an standalone application or as an Eclipse or STS plugin. It allows you to build high-quality, high-performance, lock-in-free enterprise applications in just minutes.

_What does it mean "Roo is a development tool"?_

* *Roo isn't neither a library nor a framework*. Roo is not involved with your project when it runs in production. You won't find any Roo JARs in your runtime classpath. This is actually a wonderful thing. It means you have no lock-in to worry about. It also means there is no technical way possible for Roo to slow your project down at runtime, waste memory or bloat your deployment artefacts with JARs. We're really proud of the fact that Roo imposes no engineering trade-offs, as it was one of our central design objectives.
* *Roo is not an IDE plugin*. There is no requirement for a "Roo Eclipse plugin" or "Roo IntelliJ plugin". Roo works perfectly fine in its own operating system command window. It sits there and monitors your file system, intelligently and incrementally responding to changes as appropriate. This means you're perfectly able to use vi or emacs if you'd like (Roo doesn't mind how your project files get changed).
* *Roo is not an annotation processing library*. This allows Roo to work with a much more sophisticated and extensible internal model.

Best of all, Roo works alongside your existing Java and Spring knowledge, skills and experience. You probably will not need to learn anything new to use Roo, as there is no new language or runtime platform needed. You simply program in your normal Java way and Roo just works, sitting in the background taking care of the things you do not want to worry about.

[[getting-started-whatsNew]]
== What's new in Spring Roo 2.0

=== Improved extensibility

Due to the OSGi container has been upgraded to OSGi R5, now Roo provides a new way to package and distribute a set of addons together: the Roo Addon Suite.

Roo Addon Suite is based on OSGi R5 Subsystems that provides a really convenient deployment model, without compromising the modularity of Roo.

=== No backward compatibility

Spring Roo 2.0 has important changes to achieve its goals, due to that, it contains API changes and less add-ons than previous version so *this release is not backward compatible with 1.x*.

It means Spring Roo 2.0 cannot neither update nor modify applications created with Spring Roo 1.x.

=== Usability improvements

The Spring Roo shell has improved its usability:

* More intuitive commands that provides only the necessary parameters.
* New commands to configure Spring Roo behavior.
* Maven multi-module support has been improved, now the intelligent kbd:[Ctrl+Space] (or kbd:[TAB]) completion will show you the applicable modules.
* New push-in commands for quicker and easier code customization.

=== Centered in Spring technologies

Now Spring Roo is centered in Spring technologies so addons like GWT addon and JSF addon have been moved to their own projects in order to be maintained by Roo community.

Moreover the generated applications are focused on newer Spring technologies like Spring IO platform, Spring Data, etc. Indeed, Spring Roo 2 creates Spring Boot applications.

Therefore, the XML configuration model has been replaced with the Java-based one.

==== Not only Spring

Most of the code generated by Roo is based on Spring technologies but not only on them, some parts of the application use other open source technologies, being the most important:

* http://cxf.apache.org[Apache CXF]
* https://github.com/DISID/springlets[Springlets]
* ...

=== Application architecture

The architecture of the generated applications is based on commonly used patterns, like the _Separation of Concerns principle_ and the _Domain Driven Design_.

There are hundreds of articles that explain the advantages of these patterns, but we would like to recommend:

* http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PresentationDomainDataLayering.html[Presentation Domain Data Layering], written by Martin Fowler.
* http://static.olivergierke.de/lectures/ddd-and-spring/[Domain-Driven Design and Spring], by Oliver Gierke

[align="center"]
image::n-layer-arch-full_en.png["New application architecture", width="40%"]

The most notable improvements are:

* The default multimodule project set up the layers dependencies from top to bottom.
* Modularization based on generating both the API and the implementation.
* The Active Record data model has been removed in favor of Spring Data Repositories.

=== Domain model

* Improved entity relationship management: now Roo generates the needed logic to maintain the coherence of the relations taking in account the type of the relation, _Aggretation_ or _Composition_.
* Added support and commands to generate DTO classes.

=== View layer

* Scaffold improvements:
** Controllers refactored to support entity relationships management.
** Master-detail view generation to manage the entity relations.
** Several technologies for rendering views are supported. By default Spring Roo supports:
*** Thymeleaf
*** Jackson 2

Features of the Thymeleaf views:

* Dojo has been replaced with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and jQuery components.
* They Include advanced UI components like https://select2.github.io/[Select2] and https://datatables.net/[Datatables]. The handler methods for those components (at controller classes) are also generated for easier customization.
* The Thymeleaf views include as few Javascript as possible by moving the Javascript code to _.js_ files.
* View layer generation engine is based on Freemarker templates. Additionally Roo provides a command to install them in your project letting the ability to customize the view layer scaffold before executing it.
* New amazing Spring Roo Responsive Theme!

== Spring-Roo 2.0.0.RC1 New Features

The most important changes the new version of Spring Roo features regarding Roo 2.0.0.M3 are the following:

=== Changes in the Roo Shell

* New commands which allow:
** Creating web flows in the generated applications.
** Adding email senders and receivers.
** Adding JMS senders and receivers.
** Creating Web Services clients (WSDL) and endpoints (SEI).

* Improvements on test commands using latest Spring Boot Test features:
** Improved data-on-demand generation to use in test commands.
** Improved `test unit` command which now creates fully functional tests for JPA entities.
** Improved `test integration` command which now allows integration test creation for JPA repositories and JSON/Thymeleaf controllers.

* Other command improvements:
** Improved `field ...` commands readability, removing unnecessary options and make other dynamically visible.
** Improved `push-in --method` command, allowing to distinguish between methods with same name but different arguments.
** Bug fixes.

=== Changes in generated applications

* Generated code:
** Improved read-only entities management.
** Improved Deserializers generation.
** Added default JavaDoc to all generated methods, constructors and fields.
** Created DataTables Advanced extension to apply advanced configuration on DataTables elements.

** Added concurrency control in view layer.
** Improved forms in view layer.
** Integrated http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library[JasperReports] with DataTables to allow exporting data to CSV, PDF and XLS.
** Migrated Thymeleaf views to Thymeleaf 3.
** Added new entity visualization support using `--entityFormatExpression` and `--entityFormatMessage` in some commands.
** Added support for selecting those views of a particular entity which should show details.
** Added new visualization system for one-to-one composition related entities.

** Bug fixes.

[[getting-started-requirements]]
== Requirements

To get started, please ensure you have the following system dependencies:

* A Linux, Apple or Windows-based operating system (other operating
systems may work but are not guaranteed).
* A http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/[Java JDK 6]
or newer installed. Java *JDK 7* is recommended.
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven 3.3] or above installed and in the path.

We always recommend you use the latest version of Java and Maven that are available for your platform.

[[getting-started-install-roo]]
== Install Spring Roo

We recommend you use http://spring.io/tools/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)] which includes a number of features that make working with Spring Roo even easier (you can of course link:#roo-without-ide[use Roo without an IDE] at all if you prefer).

To install Spring Roo on your STS 3.8.2+ follow the instructions below:

. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/[Java JDK 8] or newer is required.
. Download the current release from Spring Roo project page http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/#download-widget[downloads section].
. Unzip the distribution, which will unpack to a single installation directory; we will refer to it as `$ROO_HOME` from now on.
. Go to link:https://spring.io/tools/sts/all[Spring Tool Suite™ Downloads] and follow the instructions to download and install the STS.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Sometimes, when use STS/Eclipse in Windows platform, there are difficulties while trying to use the JDK VM specified in the PATH. In that case, the solution is to modify the STS/Eclipse configuration by opening _STS.ini_/_Eclipse.ini_ and adding the following lines *before* the `-vmargs` line:

* `-vm`
* `[JDK-DIR]/bin/javaw.exe`

(Don't put everything in a single line).
====
+
. Open your STS IDE.
. Install the Roo Extension from update site.
+
Because the release cycle of STS and Roo differ a version of Spring Roo may be in the Nightly or in the Release repository. This is not a problem, the installation process below will guide you which repository you should use depending on a given Roo version.

[[using-spring-roo]]
= Using Spring Roo

The goal of this section is to familiarize you with the features of Spring Roo. For this purpose, we will build an application from scratch using Roo and following a domain-driven design philosophy.

In this project we're going to create the _Northwind_ application in just ten minutes. This application is not a real application, which normally needs additional work, the goal is you understand how to use Spring Roo to create your own projects. To achieve that, we have designed this step-by-step guide to teach you almost all the Roo features.

The _Northwind_ application is used by the employees of a fictitious company called Northwind Traders, which imports and exports goods from around the world.

We chose to build the sample application using Northwind because so many developers are already familiar with the domain of the problem. If you are not familiar with Northwind's domain, don't worry. It's a simple domain model with entites for Customers, Orders, Order Details, Products, etc.

But first, let us to introduce the Roo shell.

[[using-spring-roo-shell]]
== The Roo shell

The Spring Roo shell is an interactive shell that allows you to type _Roo_ commands to perform code generation tasks.

Moreover by loading the "shell" in a window and leaving it running, as you make changes to your project, Roo intelligently determines what you're trying to do and takes care of doing it for you automatically. This usually involves automatically detecting file system changes you've made and then maintaining files in response.

We say "maintaining files" because Roo is fully round-trip aware. This means you can change any code you like, at any time and without telling Roo about it, yet Roo will intelligently and automatically deal with whatever changes need to be made in response. It might sound magical, but it isn't. This documentation will clearly explain how Roo works and you'll find yourself loving the approach - just like so the many other people who are already using Roo.

[align="center"]
image::sts-roo-shell.png["Spring Roo Shell", width="80%"]

Here are some of the usability features that make the shell so nice to work with:

* _Tab completion_: The cornerstone of command-line usability is tab assist. Hit kbd:[Ctrl+Space] (or kbd:[TAB] if you're in a bash-like shell) and Roo will show you the applicable options.
* _Command hiding_: Command hiding will remove commands which do not make sense given the current context of your project. For example, if you're in an empty directory, you can type `project`, hit kbd:[Ctrl+Space], and see the options for creating a project. But once you've created the project, the `project` command is no longer visible. The same applies for most Roo commands. This is nice as it means you only see commands which you can actually use right now. Of course, a full list of commands applicable to your version of Roo is available in the link:#application-development-command-index[command index appendix] and also via link:#help-command[help].
* _Option hiding_: Like command hiding, Roo will hide irrelevant command options for the current command context. This is specially useful for commands which have many options, giving the user an inside-command guidance by showing only the most important parameters for each moment of the command writing.
* _Contextual awareness_: Roo remembers the last Java type you are working with in your current shell session and automatically treats it as the argument to a command. You always know what Roo considers the current context because the shell prompt will indicate this just before it writes `roo>`.
* _Hinting_: Not sure what to do next? Just use the hint command. It's the perfect lightweight substitute for documentation if you're in a hurry!
* _Inbuilt help_: If you'd like to know all the options available for a given command, use the help command. It lists every option directly within the shell.
* _Automatic inline help_: Of course, it's a bit of a pain to have to go to the trouble of typing help then hitting enter if you're in the middle of typing a command. That's why we offer inline help, which is automatically displayed whenever you press kbd:[Ctrl+Space] (or kbd:[TAB]). It is listed just before the completion options. To save screen space, we only list the inline help once for a given command option. So if you type project `--template` kbd:[Ctrl+Space] (or kbd:[TAB] kbd:[TAB] kbd:[TAB]), you'd see the inline help and the completion options
* _Scripting and script recording_: Save your Roo commands and play them again later.

You'll also have other neat Roo-IDE integation features, like the ability to press kbd:[Ctrl+R] (or kbd:[Apple+R] if you're on an Apple) and a popup will allow you to type a Roo command from anywhere within the IDE. Another nice feature is the shell message hotlinking, which means all shell messages emitted by Roo are actually links that you can click to open the corresponding file in an Eclipse editor.

There are two ways to work with Spring Roo:

. Import existing Spring Roo projects. A simple import of the project using Eclipse's menu:File[Import > General > Maven Projects] menu option is sufficient.
. Create new projects, as we will see in the next section.

[[impatient-beginners]]
== Impatient beginners

Spring Roo includes some examples to see it in action instantly.

If you are in a hurry to have an Spring Boot application up and running right away, execute one of the commands below: 

[source,subs="quotes"]
.The Northwind application (Maven multimodule project)
----
*roo>* script --file northwind-multimodule.roo
----

[source,subs="quotes"]
.Shop application with REST services
----
*roo>* script --file restfulshop.roo
----

[source,subs="quotes"]
.The classic Pet Clinic application (one Maven module project)
----
*roo>* script --file clinic.roo
----

[[using-spring-roo-create-boot-app]]
== Create your Spring Boot application

. Open your STS IDE.
. Open the menu:File[New > Spring Roo Project] wizard.
+
[align="center"]
image::sts-new-roo-project.png["New Spring Roo Project", width="70%"]
. Fill the project data an press the btn:[Next >] button. Then press btn:[Finish].

Note we selected the _Multimodule Standard_ project type, so Roo created you a Spring Boot & Maven multimodule project following the usual Maven-style directory structure:

[align="center"]
image::sts-folder-structure.png["Folder structure", width="35%"]

For those familiar with Maven you will notice that this folder structure follows standard Maven conventions by creating separate folders for your main project resources and tests.

As you can see, the project extends the Spring IO platform, and it also adds the _spring boot starter_ and the _spring boot starter test_ dependencies.

Also Roo creates the Boot main application class.

Finally, both the parent pom and the modules pom files contain all required module dependencies, 3rd party dependencies and configurations to get started with the Northwind project.

== Configure the project settings

Project settings allows to set the configuration of some Roo commands. For example, in the <<entity-jpa-command, entity jpa>> and `field` commands, the table and column names are optional, the `project settings` can modify this behaviour and set those parameters as mandatory so you don't forget to set the names.

[align="center"]
image::sts-project-settings.png["Setup the project settings", width="60%"]

Just type the Roo command on the right of the shell prompt, identified as *roo>*, and Roo will do the hard work.

In this example, disable it so you can go faster:

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Set schema object names as optional
----
*roo>* settings add --name spring.roo.jpa.require.schema-object-name --value false --force
----

[NOTE]
====
From now on we will ilustrate the examples using commands in text format for easier test, just copying & pasting them in the STS Spring Roo shell.
====

[[using-spring-roo-create-data-layer]]
== Setup the persistence engine

Once the project structure is created by Roo you can go ahead and install the data access layer configuration for your application.

Roo leverages the Spring Data JPA which provides a convenient abstraction to achieve object-relational mapping. JPA takes care of mappings between the persistent domain objects (entities) and their underlying database tables and Spring Data reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to implement the data access layer.

Execute the following command to configure the data access layer in the default Spring profile:

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Setup data access layer
----
*roo>* jpa setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_PERSISTENT
----

To change that configuration or to create another persistence configuration in a distinct Spring Profile you can use the `jpa setup` command as many times as needed. The command below will create another data access layer configuration in the `dev` profile:

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Setup data access layer for dev profile
----
*roo>* jpa setup --provider HIBERNATE --database H2_IN_MEMORY --profile dev
----

== The domain model

[align="center"]
image::northwind-diagram.png["Northwind diagram", width="80%", link="{imagesdir}/northwind-diagram.png"]

This class diagram represents a simplified model of the problem domain for the Northwind company, it is a good starting point for the application in order to deliver a first prototype.

=== JPA entities

Following the above class diagram, run the next commands to generate the Northwind domain entities:

. Move to the module in which the model will be created:
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* module focus --moduleName model
----
. Create the enums to use in the application:
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Period, Status and Trimester enums
----
*roo>* enum type --class ~.Period
     enum constant --name QUARTERLY --class ~.Period
     enum constant --name ANNUAL --class ~.Period
    
     enum type --class ~.Status
     enum constant --name NEWLY --class ~.Status
     enum constant --name SEND_BILL --class ~.Status
     enum constant --name SENT --class ~.Status
     enum constant --name CLOSED --class ~.Status
     enum constant --name CANCELED --class ~.Status
    
     enum type --class ~.Trimester
     enum constant --name FIRST_TRIM --class ~.Trimester
     enum constant --name SECOND_TRIM --class ~.Trimester
     enum constant --name THIRD_TRIM --class ~.Trimester
     enum constant --name FOURTH_TRIM --class ~.Trimester
----
. Create the entities:
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Domain entities
----
*roo>* entity jpa --class ~.City --readOnly
     entity jpa --class ~.Country --readOnly
     entity jpa --class ~.Region --readOnly
     entity jpa --class ~.Category 
     entity jpa --class ~.OrderDetail
     entity jpa --class ~.Party 
     entity jpa --class ~.PurchaseOrder 
     entity jpa --class ~.Report 
     entity jpa --class ~.Shipper
     entity jpa --class ~.SoldProduct
     entity jpa --class ~.Store
     entity jpa --class ~.Supplier
----
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Entity inheritance
----
*roo>* entity jpa --class ~.Customer --extends ~.Party --force
     entity jpa --class ~.Employee --extends ~.Party --force
----
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Create the entities with special format when showing them in view layer. The format can be specified by a Spring Expression Language expression and also with a localized message (wich can contain a SpEL too):
----
*roo>* entity jpa --class ~.Product --entityFormatExpression "#{name} #{code}"
     entity jpa --class ~.CustomerOrder --entityFormatMessage customerorder_format
----
. Add the attributes to the entites:
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Entity attributes and relationships
----

=== Spring Data repositories

It is possible to specify an entity projection as a default return type for repository queries:

* Create the entity projection:
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* entity projection --class model:~.CustomerInfo --entity model:~.Customer --fields id,companyName,email,fax --entityFormatExpression #{companyName}
----
+
* Create the repository for the entity, which will use the projection as default return type of queries:
+
[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* repository jpa --entity model:~.Customer --interface repository:~.CustomerRepository --defaultReturnType model:~.CustomerInfo
----

Create repositories for all the remaining entities:

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* repository jpa --all
----

=== Default queries

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* finder add --entity *model:*~.Shipper --name findByCompanyName
     finder add --entity model:~.Region --name findByCountryIdOrderByDescriptionAsc
     finder add --entity model:~.City --name findByRegionIdOrderByDescriptionAsc
     finder add --entity model:~.Product --name findByDiscontinuedOrderByNameAsc
     finder add --entity model:~.Shipper --name findByPhone --formBean model:~.ShipperPhoneFormBean
----

Since Spring Roo 2.0, the multimodule support lets to prefix the module name to the entity path to select the Maven module in which the new entity will be created. Spring Roo will propose the available module names when hit kbd:[Ctrl+Space] (or kbd:[TAB] if you're in a bash-like shell).

[[the-view-layer]]
== The view layer

The Spring Roo Web MVC scaffolding can deliver a fully functional web frontend and REST API to your domain business logic. The scaffolding support allows you to scaffold Spring MVC controllers, Thymeleaf views and REST API for an existing domain model.

First of all, you must add the web support to the application. All needed updates in the project will be performed by Roo.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Setup the view layer
----
*roo>* web mvc setup
----

Remember that now, Roo generates applications centered in Spring technologies, you will notice that the generated artifacts configure Spring MVC in your application.

In Spring Roo 2 the view layer generation system has been refactored to support several technologies for rendering views. Spring Roo 2 supports <<thymeleaf-view-engine,Thymeleaf>> and <<rest-api,Jackson>>.

[[thymeleaf-view-engine]]
=== Thymeleaf view engine

The `web mvc view setup` allows you to install and configure the artifacts that will let to scaffold a Thymeleaf based view layer.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* web mvc view setup --type THYMELEAF
----

Optionally, you can tell Roo to copy the templates it uses to generate the view templates to the application's _.roo/templates/thymeleaf/_ directory, allowing the developers to customize them for code generation:

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Install the templates to generate the view templates
----
*roo>* web mvc templates setup --type THYMELEAF
----

Spring Roo uses http://freemarker.org/[Freemarker] templates for generating the Thymeleaf view templates, you will notice that the _.roo/templates/thymeleaf/_ contains the _.ftl_ files. 

[[spring-mvc-contollers]]
=== Spring MVC Controllers

The controller command will scaffold the given domain entity and it will create both the Spring MVC controllers and the templates to generate the view response .

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Generate the views and controllers to manage the domain entities (CRUD)
----
*roo>* web mvc controller --entity model:~.Category --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Country --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.CustomerOrder --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Customer --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Employee --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Product --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Shipper --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.SoldProduct --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Store --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Supplier --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.City --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.Region --responseType THYMELEAF
     web mvc controller --entity model:~.PurchaseOrder --responseType THYMELEAF
----

As you can see, since Spring Roo 2.0 the `web mvc controller` has the parameter `--responseType` that lets to indicate the rendering view technology to scaffold. You can chose one of the two available rendering view technologies:

* _JSON_ (default), generate JSON messages using Jackson 2.
* _THYMELEAF_, generate HTML5 pages using Thymeleaf template engine.

==== Entity relationship management

You can generate master-detail views to manage the entity relations as follows:

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Relationship controllers and views
----
*roo>* web mvc detail --entity model:~.Category --field products --responseType THYMELEAF --views list,show
     web mvc detail --entity model:~.Product --field purchaseOrders --responseType THYMELEAF --views list,show
     web mvc detail --entity model:~.Country --responseType THYMELEAF --field regions --views list,show
     web mvc detail --entity model:~.Region --responseType THYMELEAF --field cities --views list,show
----

==== Search support

Finally, create the views to search entities.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Search controllers and views
----
*roo>* web mvc finder --all --responseType THYMELEAF
----

=== Spring Webflow

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.CustomerOrder web flow
----
*roo>* web flow --flowName customerOrdersFlow --class ~.CustomerOrderFormBean
----

== The integration layer

Today, applications must necessarily connect to many types of external systems. Spring Roo generate the connectors to send data  and the endpoints to receive information to and from those systems in the outside.

[[rest-api]]
=== REST API

Spring Roo can create a full REST API to manage the entities. You only have to execute the command below and Roo will generate one Spring MVC REST controller for each entity.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.REST services
----
*roo>* web mvc controller --all --pathPrefix /api
----

Roo has generated the controllers with handler methods to create, update, delete single entities and collection of entities. In addition, the controllers will have methods to find data following the REST principles.

=== WS API

Spring Roo generate SOAP Services easily, available under `/services` URL.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.WebServices
----
*roo>* ws endpoint --service service-api:~.CategoryService --sei application:~.ws.api.CategoryWebService --class application:~.ws.endpoint.CategoryWebServiceEndpoint --config application:~.config.WsEndpointsConfiguration
----

=== Email

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Send email
----
*roo>* email sender setup --service service-impl:~.CustomerServiceImpl --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --host HOST --port 1000 --protocol PROTOCOL --starttls true
----

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
.Receive email
----
*roo>* email receiver setup --service service-impl:~.EmployeeServiceImpl --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --host HOST --port 1000 --protocol PROTOCOL --starttls true
----

[[the-security-layer]]
== The security layer

Create and configure the Spring Security artifacts that will protect your application.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* security setup --provider SPRINGLETS_JPA
----

As you can see, since Spring Roo 2.0 the `security setup` has the parameter `--provider` that will let to indicate which security provider will create the security artifacts.

A security provider is simply a configurer that will create and configure the security artifacts in its way.

Currently you can chose one of the two available providers:

* _DEFAULT_, configures the Spring Boot security defaults.
* _SPRINGLETS_JPA_, sets the Spring Boot defaults plus the Springlets JPA authentication provider.

Now, grant the permissions that restricts executing the domain logic, for example, only the users with roles `ADMIN` or `EMPLOYEE` are granted to delete customers.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* security authorize --class service-api:~.CustomerService --method delete --roles ADMIN,EMPLOYEE
----

=== Auditing JPA entities

Adds support for auditing a JPA entity. It will add the Spring Data JPA entity listener to capture auditing information on persiting and updating entities.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* jpa audit setup
     jpa audit add --entity model:~.Category
----

== The infraestructure layer

By _infraestructure layer_ we means the layer that contains those project artifacts that aren't related directly with the problem domain, like tests, logging, etc.

[source,sh,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* test unit --class model:~.CustomerOrder
     test unit --class model:~.Category
     test unit --class model:~.Product
     
     test integration --class repository:~.CategoryRepository

----

[[using-spring-roo-customize-roo-generated-code]]
== Customize the code

You can easily modify the Roo-generated code by using the Eclipse/STS AJDT Refactoring Push-in feature.

The AJDT refactoring moves intertype declarations (methods, fields, etc) into their target types. From then, the method, field, etc. will be in the Java source file. Roo detects that change in the project and the declaration in the Java file will take priority over code generation so Roo won't re-generate it whereas the declaration is in the Java file.

To _push-in_ the Roo-generated code:

. Edit Java source file.
. Open the link:http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/xref/[Cross References] view.
+
NOTE: If the Cross References view is empty you must re-build the project by executing menu:Project[Clean ...] It occurs when the crosscutting information is missing, so you must re-build the project in order to re-generate the crosscutting information shown in the Cross References view.
+
[align="center"]
image::sts-cross-references.png["Cross References View", width="60%"]
. Double click on the aspect declaration. The the ITD file is opened in the AspectJ/Java editor.

. Right click ont he aspect declaration, then run menu:AspectJ_Refactoring[Push In ...].

. Finally re-build the project by executing menu:Project[Clean].

At this point, the developer can modify the Java source file, Roo will not overwrite or modify any Java source file.

A quicker way to take the control of the generated code is using the `push-in` command. This command moves in batch, intertype declarations into the target type. For example you can move the classes in one package from the .aj file to the .java file executing one command only:

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* push-in --package model:org.northwind.model
----

In summary, you can easily modify the Roo-generated code by using the Eclipse/STS AJDT Push-in feature or by using the `push-in` command.

[NOTE]
.Project without .aj files
====
A simple way of stopping to use Roo is to simply never load it again. The *_Roo_*.aj files will still be on disk and your project will continue to work regardless of whether the Roo shell is never launched again. You can even uninstall the Roo system from your computer and your project will still work. The advantage of working in this way is that you have not lost the benefits of using Roo, and it is very easy to use Roo shell again in the future. 

Spring Roo needs that .aj files to maintain the generated code automatically. Is not possible to know which code has been generated by Spring Roo shell and which code has been modified by developers without the .aj files.

Anyway, if you don't want to have .aj files in your generated project, you could use the following command to make push-in of all the generated code:

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
*roo>* push-in --all --force
----

[[javadoc-asciidoc]]
== Javadoc in AsciiDoc

Spring Roo generated projects automatically include the "maven-javadoc-plugin" to generate project documentation following AsciiDoc syntax. This configuration it's done by using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoclet["Asciidoclet"]. 

To generate the project's documentation you can follow the following steps:

. Go to the STS "Package Explorer".
. Right click in the project and go to menu:RunAs[Run Configurations...]
+
image::sts-maven-run-configurations.png["images/sts-maven-run-configurations.png"]
+
. In the window that will open, double click in btn:[Maven Build] item from submenu.
. In the configuration window, specify *javadoc:aggregate* as Maven goal.
. Set the project's root directory as "Base directory". You can easily do it by clicking _Workspace..._ and selecting the root module of your project.
+
image::generate-javadoc-config.png["images/generate-javadoc-config.png"]
+
. Apply configuration and close the window, or execute it directly with _Run_.
. The generated JavaDoc will be in _"[ROOT-PROJECT]/target/site/apidocs/"_.

[[using-spring-roo-running-app]]
== Running the application

You can deploy your project using "Boot Dashboard":

. Go to the _"Boot Dashboard"_ view.
. Select the right module of your project, one of the modules that contain a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`. Then press btn:[Start] button
+
[align="center"]
image::sts-boot-dashboard.png["Boot Dashboard", width="50%"]
. The application should be available under the following URL http://localhost:8080/Northwind

If Roo logo appears, you have installed Roo successfully. For those curious, the "[rev RRR]" refers to the Git commit ID used to compile that particular build of Roo.

[[using-spring-roo-deployment-and-backup]]
=== Backup and deployment

A very useful command is the link:#backup-command[backup] command. Using this command you will create a backup of the current workspace with all sources, log files and the script log file (excluding the target directory):

[source,sh,subs=quotes]
----
*roo>* backup
----

Finally, you may wish to deploy your application to a production Web container. For this you can easily create two war files, by using the Maven command `mvn package` in the project base directory. You can perform this as well without exiting from Roo shell by using link:#os-command[`!os`] command, providing you have Maven in the `$PATH` variable:

[source,sh,subs=quotes]
----
*roo>* !os mvn package
----

This command generates a "*.war" file which can then be easily copied into your production Web container and a "*exec.war" file that uses a embedded web server.

You can execute "*exec.war" as follows:

[source,sh,subs=quotes]
----
$ java -jar name-exec.war
----

NOTE: The provider dependencies are added only in "*exec.war" file.


[appendix]
[[resources]]
== Roo Resources

As an open source project, Spring Roo offers a large number of resources
to assist the community learn, interact with one another and become more
involved in the project. Below you'll find a short summary of the
official project resources.

[[resources-home]]
=== Spring Roo Project Home Page

The definitive source of information about Spring Roo is the
http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/[Spring Roo Home] at http://spring.io[http://spring.io].

That site provides a brief summary of Roo's main features and links to most of
the other project resources. The project home page serves as a hub of
information and is the best place to find up-to-date announcements about the
project as well as links to articles, blogs and new documentation.

Please use this URI if you are referring other people to the Spring Roo project,
as it is the main landing point for the project.

[[resources-downloads]]
=== Downloads and Maven Repositories

You can always access the latest Spring Roo release ZIP by visiting Downloads section at
http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/#running-from-shell[Spring Roo Home Page].

We publish all Roo modules to Maven Central, the default repository from which
Maven will download the Spring Roo artifacts automatically.

[[resources-stackoverflow]]
=== StackOverFlow

Because Roo is an official top-level Spring project, of course you'll find there is a
dedicated "Spring Roo" tag at Stack Overflow for all your questions, comments
and experiences.

If you have any question about Spring Roo project and its functionalities,
you can check and ask at
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-roo[Spring Roo tagged questions at Stack Overflow].
We monitor stackoverflow.com for questions tagged with spring-roo.

http://forum.springsource.org is now a read-only archive.
All commenting, posting, registration services have been turned off.

The Roo project does not have a "mailing list" or "newsgroup" as you
might be familiar with from other open source projects, although
link:#resources-commercial[commercial support] options are available.

Extensive search facilities are provided on the community forums, and
the Roo developers routinely answer user questions. One excellent way of
contributing to the Roo project is to simply keep an eye on the forum
messages and help other people. Even recommendations along the lines of,
"I don't know how to do what you're trying to do, but we usually tackle
the problem this way instead...." are very helpful to other community
members.

When you ask a question on the forum, it's highly recommended you
include a small Roo link:#using-spring-roo-northwind-script[sample script] that can be used to
reproduce your problem. If that's infeasible, using Roo's
"link:#backup-command[backup]" command is another alternative and you
can attach the resulting ZIP file to your post. Other tips include
always specifying the version of Roo that you're running (as can be
obtained from the "link:#version-command[version]" command), and
if you're having trouble with IDE integration, the exact version of the
IDE you are using (and, if an Eclipse-based IDE, the version of
link:http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/[AspectJ Development Tools] in use). Another good source
of advice on how to ask questions on the forum can be found in Eric
Raymond's often-cited essay,
"link:http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html[How to Ask Smart
Questions]".

If you believe you have found a bug or are experiencing an issue, it is
recommended you first log a message on the forum. This allows other
experienced users to comment on whether it appears there is a problem
with Roo or perhaps just needs to be used a different way. Someone will
usually offer a solution or recommend you log a bug report (usually by
saying "please log this in Jira"). When you do log a bug report, please
ensure you link to the fully-qualified URI to the forum post. That way
the developer who attempts to solve your bug will have background
information. Please also post the issue tracking link back in thread you
started on the forum, as it will help other people cross-reference the
two systems.

[[resources-twitter]]
=== Twitter

Roo Hash Code (please include in your tweets, and also follow for
low-volume announcements):
https://twitter.com/#springroo[#SpringRoo]

If you use Twitter, you're encouraged to follow @SpringRoo. Also
please use @SpringRoo in your tweets so everyone can easily see them.

The Roo team also uses and monitors tweets that include #SpringRoo, so
if you're tweeting about Roo, please remember to include #SpringRoo somewhere in
the tweet. If you like Roo or have found it helpful on a project, please
tweet about it and help spread the word!

Follow the core Roo development team for interesting Roo news and
progress (higher volume than just following @SpringRoo, but only a few
Tweets per week):
http://twitter.com/disid_corp[@disid_corp],
http://twitter.com/juanCaFX[@juanCaFX],
https://twitter.com/enrique_ruiz_[@enrique_ruiz_].

Many people who use Roo also use Twitter, including the core Roo
development team. If you're a Twitter user, you're welcome to follow the
Roo development team (using the Twitter IDs above) to receive
up-to-the-minute Tweets on Roo activities, usage and events.

We do request that you use the link:#resources-stackoverflow[StackOverFlow]
if you have a question or issue with Roo, as 140 characters doesn't
allow us to provide in-depth technical support or provide a growing
archive of historical answers that people can search against.

[[resources-issue-tracking]]
=== Issue Tracking

Web: https://jira.spring.io/browse/ROO/

Spring projects use Atlassian Jira for tracking bugs, improvements,
feature requests and tasks. Roo uses a public Jira instance you're
welcome to use in order to log issues, watch existing issues, vote for
existing issues and review the changes made between particular versions.

As discussed in the link:#resources-stackoverflow[StackOverFlow] section, we
ask that you refrain from logging bug reports until you've first
discussed them on stackoverflow. This allows others to comment on whether a
bug actually exists. When logging an issue in Jira, there is a field
explicitly provided so you can link the forum discussion to the Jira
issue.

Please note that every commit into the Roo
link:#resources-source-repository[source repository] will be prefixed
with a particular Jira issue number. All Jira issue numbers for the Roo
project commence with "ROO-", providing you an easy way to determine the
rationale of any change.

Because open source projects receive numerous enhancement requests, we
generally prioritise enhancements that have patches included, are quick
to complete or those which have received a large number of votes. You
can vote for a particular issue by logging into Jira (it's fast, easy
and free to create an account) and click the "vote" link against any
issue. Similarly you can monitor the progress on any issue you're
interested in by clicking "watch".

Enhancement requests are easier to complete (and therefore more probable
to be actioned) if they represent fine-grained units of work that
include as much detail as possible. Enhancement requests should describe
a specific use case or user story that is trying to be achieved. It is
usually helpful to provide a Roo link:#using-spring-roo-northwind-script[sample script] that
can be used to explain the issue. You should also consider whether a
particular enhancement is likely to appeal to most Roo users, and if
not, whether perhaps writing it as an add-on would
be a good alternative.

[[resources-source-repository]]
=== Source Repository

Read repository: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-roo.git
