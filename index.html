{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Roo differs from other productivity tools by focusing on:

* Rapid results
* 100% develop in Java
* Easy-to-use
* Fast and simple to remove
* Totally compromise free
* Active, helpful community
* Comprehensive technology integrations
* Extension points via Roo add-ons
* Spring-certified architecture

## Instant Results - Making Java Fun

Spring Roo is a lightweight developer tool that makes it fast and easy to deliver instant results. Best of all, you code 100% in Java and get to reuse all your existing Java knowledge, skills and experience.

Read the book [Getting Started with Roo](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020981.do) written by Josh Long and Steve Mayzak.

Ken Rimple and Srini Penchikala have also written the definitive Roo reference book called [Spring Roo in Action](http://www.manning.com/rimple/) available for purchase from Manning Publications.

## Exciting Features - SOLR, CLOUD, FLEX,...

MVC applications with JPA are a breeze with Roo, but it also eases your journey into the next generation of technology. We already support cool features like Solr for search server integration and cloud deployment like Google App Engine. Plus we have incremental database introspection, Flex, Spring Integration and much more actively in development.

## Zero Risks - Productivity Without Compromise

With Roo you still program everything in Java. Its innovative approach operates entirely at compile-time and is completely compatible with your IDE. Plus because there's no runtime portion, adoption is also simplified and low risk. All your Java developers will feel comfortable and be productive from day one. Roo really represents productivity without compromise.
